The idea is to make use of [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) to convert [PocketSphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/)) into JavaScript and feed the recognizer with audio recorded with the Web Audio API.\r\n\r\n### Current status.\r\nIt pretty much works, assuming you are using Chrome with a functional audio hardware setting. We have found that on many platforms and hardware, the audio data recoded through the Web Audio API are silent, this will hopefully be addressed soon.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
