Test suite for Pocketsphinx.js
==============================

We are adding tests for the different components. The tests are built on [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com) and can be run by opening the respective html files in a browser. For now, there are only tests for `pocketsphinx.js`, and they should all pass.
