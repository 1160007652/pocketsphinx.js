PocketSphinx.js
---------------
### Speech Recognition in JavaScript

PocketSphinx.js is an attempt to perform speech recognition entirely in the web browser. The idea is to:

* convert a speech recognizer written in C ([PocketSphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/)) into JavaScript using [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten),
* record audio using the Web audio API and send it to the recognizer.


### 1. Compiling and executing the test application

For now, we have a small test that initializes a PocketSphinx decoder. The build is generated with CMake and makes use of LLVM. It should work, for now, on Linux and Mac OSX:

    $ cd .../pocketsphinx.js # This folder
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DEMSCRIPTEN=1 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path_to_emscripten/cmake/Platform/Emscripten_unix.cmake ..
    $ make

This should generate `pocketsphinx.js`, a javascript library that wraps some of PocketSphinx API. Copy that file into `webapp/js` and open the demo web app:

    $ cd webapp
    $ firefox index.html &

You should see logging information from execution of some tests of the API. See inside `index.html` and `webapp.js` for details.

On Google Chrome, launch it with `--disable-web-security`.

### 2. Library

Look at webapp.js for a simpler wrapper around the library generated by emscripten. Here is an overview on how to use it directly:

    $ z = Module.cwrap('psGetState') 
    $ z()           # Should be 0
    $ x = Module.cwrap('psInitialize')
    $ y = x()         # Should be 0 if successful
    $ z()           # Should be 1

To pass strings:

    $ var word = "HELLO"
    $ var pron = "AH OW T"
    $ worp_ptr = Module.allocate(intArrayFromString(word), 'i8', ALLOC_STACK)
    $ pron_ptr = Module.allocate(intArrayFromString(pron), 'i8', ALLOC_STACK)
    $ var add_word = Module.cwrap('psAddWord', 'number', ['number','number'])
    $ add_word(word_ptr, pron_ptr)           # Should return 0


To pass binary data:

    $ var buffer = Module.allocate(10, 'i16', ALLOC_NORMAL) # Buffer for 10 short ints
    $ setValue(buffer, 0, 'i16')
    $ setValue(buffer+2, 1, 'i16')
    $ setValue(buffer+4, 2, 'i16')     # and so on...
    $ var process_data = Module.cwrap('psProcessData', 'number', ['number','number'])
    $ process_data(buffer, 10)


### 3. Live demo

The file `webapp/live.html` is an example of live recognition using the web audio API. For now it seems like recognition is slower than real time on my machine so it crashes after a few iterations.

### 4. Acoustic model

The `am` folder contains an acoustic model trained with [SphinxTrain](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/tutorialam). It is built using the [RM1](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/databases/rm1/index.html) corpus, semi-continuous, with 200 senones.

### 5. PocketSphinx

pocketsphinx.js ships with PocketSphinx and Sphinxbase version 0.8 without modification except that the `model` folder of PocketSphinx (which contains large acoustic and language models) was not included.

### 6. License

PocketSphinx licensing terms are included in the `pocketsphinx` and `sphinxbase` folders.
